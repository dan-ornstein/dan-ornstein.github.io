## Homepage Intro

Welcome to my website.

Here you'll find out more about my work, especially my writing and teaching. Since 1994, I've been the rabbi of Congregation Ohav Shalom and a writer living with my family in Albany, New York, where I also teach Judaic Studies at the Hebrew Academy of The Capital District. I'm the author of Cain v.. Abel: A Jewish Courtroom Drama (Jewish Publication Society 2020). I blog at the Times Of Israel, I write monthly for WAMC Northeast Public Radio, and I've contributed essays to The Jewish Forward, the Jerusalem Post, and the Lehrhaus, as well as My Jewish Learning (coming this summer 2022). I've also published essays and poetry for the Mesorah Matrix series on Judaism, at the Journal of Conservative Judaism, the CCAR Journal of Reform Judaism, the Jewish Literary Journal, and the Pine Hills Review. My wife, Marian Alexander, and I are the proud parents of Joseph, Shulamit and Vered.
